# HousingPrices-MachineLearning
A look at an end-to-end machine project courtesy of "Hands of Machine Learning with Scikit Learn and Tensor Flow." From the vantage point of a Californian real-estate mogul, machine learning methods we used to determine and predict fair houshold prices within a given district which were calculated by average price by district and historical volatility within the Californian housing market. 

This code was originally programmed in Jupyter Notebook and converted to a standard .py file. To see price visualization, I recommend reconnecting the code to Jupyter Notebook.
